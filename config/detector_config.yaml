# Drowsiness Detector Configuration
# All time-based thresholds in SECONDS (converted to frames at runtime)

# Episode Detection
drowsiness:
  start_threshold_sec: 0.5        # Time of low EAR to START episode
  end_grace_sec: 1.5              # Time of normal EAR to END episode
  min_episode_sec: 2.0            # Minimum episode duration to log
  
# Blink Detection
blink:
  closed_frames: 2                # Frames with eyes closed = 1 blink

# Yawn Detection
yawn:
  threshold_sec: 0.27             # Time with mouth open to detect yawn
  cooldown_sec: 2.0               # Cooldown before next yawn

# Expression Suppression
expression:
  smile_suppress_sec: 0.5         # Suppress drowsiness after smile
  laugh_suppress_sec: 0.67        # Suppress drowsiness after laugh

# User Recognition
user:
  swap_threshold: 0.8             # Face encoding distance for user swap

# Image Quality
image:
  local_quality: 85               # JPEG quality for local SQLite
  remote_quality: 70              # JPEG quality for remote server
